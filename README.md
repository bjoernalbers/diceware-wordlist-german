# German Diceware Wordlist for Random Passphrases

## What are passphrases anyway?

A [Passphrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passphrase) is a password made
up of multiple words, such as:

    correct horse battery staple

Passphrases are excellent passwords because they are easy to remember (for you)
and hard to guess (for others):

## Why you need a wordlist

A strong passphrase consists of *randomly* selected words.
However, if you make up the words yourself, those words might not be as random
as you think.
Using words like the name of your spouse, dog, soccer club or favourite boy
band, are easy to guess for others and will result in insecure passphrases.

To create truly random and therefore secure passphrases, you should use either
a *passphrase generator* or
[Diceware](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html).
Both methods require a list of words to pick words from.
A typical diceware wordlist consists of 6^5 = 7,776 words.
