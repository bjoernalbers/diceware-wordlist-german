# German Diceware Wordlist for Random Passphrases

**Work in Progress**

## Wait a minute, what are passphrases anyway?

A [Passphrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passphrase) is a password made
up of multiple words, such as:

    correct horse battery staple

Passphrases are excellent passwords because they are easy to remember (for you)
and hard to guess (for others):

## And what exactly is Diceware?

[Diceware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware) is a method to generate
those passphrases using ordinary dice, invented by Arnold Reinhold.
You simply roll five dice to pick a random word from a Diceware wordlist until
you have enough words.
This repository provides such a list.

## Wordlist formats

The wordlist is available in these formats:

- `wordlist-german.txt`: original german wordlist with correct capitalization
- `wordlist-german-lowercase.txt`: lowercase version of the wordlist above
- `wordlist-german-diceware.txt`: the actual german diceware wordlist made from
  the lowercase wordlist

## About the included words

Each word has been manually checked to be familiar and office-friendly
(not vulgar, offensive, religious or with negative connotations).
The words also meet these formal conditions:

- 3 to 8 characters long
- contains english letters only (no german special characters like umlauts)
- a known noun, verb or adjective in its basic form

## Where do all those words come from?

All words have been taken from the digital german dictionary
[DWDS](https://www.dwds.de/):

> DWDS â€“ Digitales WÃ¶rterbuch der deutschen Sprache.
> Das Wortauskunftssystem zur deutschen Sprache in Geschichte und Gegenwart,
> hrsg. v. d. Berlin-Brandenburgischen Akademie der Wissenschaften,
